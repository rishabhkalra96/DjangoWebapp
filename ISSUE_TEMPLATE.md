There is no such issue template to post or raise any issues in the project.

However, please make sure that you atleast once notify the author of the project before posting an issue to make sure if the issue can be 
taken into account or not. If the author does not reply back within 72 hours, you can post it as an issue with proper label.

While raising an issue, please write down the title of the issue, clearly understandable for even the beginner developers, we want our
project description (even the issues raised) to be as much user friendly as possible.The description should be as much elaborate as possible

If needed, pleasse include the steps to reproduce a particular problem or issue with clear understanding and include "what is to be expected?"
title with the final result expected when the issue is resolved.

For example, if there is a button which is not working properly and you decide to raise an issue, below would be a simple yet elaborate example

--START--
TITLE : Button in the homepage disables as soon as it is clicked

DESCRIPTION : The upload picture button in the home page disables once you click it. This happens in devices of all types.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE
1. LOGIN TO THE WEBAPP
2. GOTO YOUR PROFILE
3. CLICK ON UPLOAD PHOTO
4. THE BUTTON DISABLES

WHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED?
The button should not disable no matter the picture is uploaded or not. It should work as intended.

--END--

The above issue can be labelled as "good first issue" "javascript" "beginner" "UI enhancement" and others to name a few.

NOTE : NO ISSUE IS TO BE RAISED WITHOUT A PROPER LABEL BEING SET. IF AN ACCORDING LABEL DOES NOT EXISTS, CONTACT THE AUTHORS FOR ALTERNATIVES.
